## My Experience: From Zero to Protocol Contributor

I was selected for **Summer of Bitcoin** to work with **[Ark Labs](https://arklabs.to)**, the team behind the **Ark Protocol** a novel layer-2 for Bitcoin that enables fast, low-cost, self-custodial transactions.

My task? **Design and implement a zero-collateral lottery system** on Ark a provably fair, decentralized game where players don’t need to lock up extra funds to participate.

Coming in, I had **minimal Bitcoin knowledge**. I didn’t understand Taproot, or even how Lightning worked. I treated them as black boxes.

But that’s the beauty of **Summer of Bitcoin**: it’s not about what you know, it’s about what you’re willing to learn.

Over the summer, I went from reading Bitcoin Core docs to implementing **multi-party commitment schemes**, **Taproot spending trees**, and **offchain coordination protocols** all while building a production-ready SDK: **[arkive-sdk](https://github.com/pingu-73/arkive-sdk)**.

This post is my **getting-started guide** for future contributors not just to Ark, but to **Bitcoin systems programming**.

## Getting Started with Ark: Know Your Foundations

Ark is **not a replacement for Lightning** as [Marco](https://x.com/tierotiero) says, it’s a **complement**. It’s designed for **self-custodial, offchain execution** with **onchain finality**, using Bitcoin’s UTXO model in a novel way.

But to contribute meaningfully, you need a solid grasp of:

### **Bitcoin Fundamentals**
- **UTXO model** and transaction structure
- **Scripting**: `OP_CHECKSIG`, `OP_CSV`, `OP_HASH256`
- **Sighash modes** (`SIGHASH_ALL`, `SIGHASH_SINGLE`, etc.)
- **SegWit and Taproot** — especially **key-path vs. script-path spends**
- **MuSig2** for efficient multisignatures

Without this, Ark’s design will feel like magic. With it, you’ll see the **elegance**.

### **Helpful, But Not Required**
- **Lightning Network**: Understand channel mechanics, HTLCs, and routing
- **State channels** and **commitment transactions**
- **Cryptographic commitments** (hash-based, Schnorr-based)

You don’t need to be an expert but you **must be willing to learn**.

## The Challenges: Ark Isn’t Perfect (And That’s Okay)

Ark is powerful, but it’s not without trade-offs. Here are the big ones:

### **1. Liquidity Burden on the Server**
Unlike Lightning, where liquidity is shared between peers, **Ark Service Providers (ASPs)** must front **all the liquidity** for the batch.

If users deposit 10 BTC, the ASP must lock up **at least x4 times the liquidity that lightning would require** and more if there are preconfirmed VTXOs.

This makes ASPs **capital-intensive**, but it enables **instant, trustless coordination**.

### **2. Mempool Pressure at Scale**
Ark batches transactions every few seconds (e.g., 5s) and submits a **Commitment Transaction** to Bitcoin.

While this is efficient per user, **at scale**, if many ASPs batch frequently, they could **saturate the mempool**.

Possible solutions?
- **Inter-ASP coinjoin**: All ASPs batch together into a single onchain transaction
- **Dynamic batch timing**: Adjust batch intervals based on network load
- **Fee-aware batching**: Delay non-critical batches during congestion

This is an **open research problem** and a great area for future contributors.

### **3. DoS Resistance is Limited**
Ark isn’t fully DoS-resistant. A malicious server could:
- Censor transactions
- Delay batch swaps
- Fail to co-sign

But users can always **unilaterally exit** though this costs onchain fees.

So the threat model is: **The server can grief, but not steal.**

And that’s a **good trade-off** for usability.

## My Work: Building a Zero-Collateral Lottery

My project was to build a **zero-collateral lottery**, inspired by the [Miller & Bentov paper](https://fc16.ifca.ai/bitcoin/papers/Mil16.pdf), but adapted to **Ark’s offchain model**.

### The Core Idea
- Players **commit** to a random value (via hash)
- After all commit, they **reveal** their secrets
- Winner is determined **deterministically** from the combined randomness
- Winner receives the **entire pot**, losers’ funds are forfeited

No collateral. No trusted third party. Just cryptography.

### The Architecture
I designed a system where:
1. Each player funds a **VTXO** into the lottery
2. They **pre-sign a forfeit transaction** that says:  
   *"If I lose, my VTXO goes to the winner"*
3. When the winner is determined, the server **co-signs the forfeit transactions** from losers
4. A **batch swap** settles the payout to the winner’s new VTXO

The key insight?  
> **The forfeit transaction is the smart contract.**  
> The **batch swap is the settlement layer.**

This is **Bitcoin-native programmability** no EVM, no bridges.

### The SDK: arkive-sdk
I built **[arkive-sdk](https://github.com/pingu-73/arkive-sdk)** — a Rust-based SDK that includes:
- Wallet management with **backup & sync**
- VTXO lifecycle tracking
- **Zero-collateral lottery** with escrow scripts
- CLI for testing and demo

It’s designed to be **production-ready**, with proper error handling, storage, and security.

## Impact & Benefits of My Work

This isn’t just a lottery. It’s a **primitive** for **Bitcoin smart contracts**.

### **Proves Zero-Collateral Games Are Possible on Bitcoin**
No more $O(N^2)$ deposits. Players only risk their bet.

### **Demonstrates Trust-Minimized Offchain Coordination**
The server **verifies**, doesn’t decide. Rules are open, deterministic.

### **Introduces Forfeit Trees as a Smart Contract Pattern**
This can be reused for:
- **Decentralized exchanges**
- **Prediction markets**
- **Leader election**
- **AI payments**

### **Lowers the Barrier to Ark Development**
`arkive-sdk` provides a **clean, high-level API** for building on Ark something the ecosystem needs.

## Final Thoughts

Working on Ark taught me that **Bitcoin is programmable** just not in the way Ethereum taught us.

It’s **programmable through ownership**, **signatures**, and **time-locked conditions**.

And Ark unlocks that power with **self-custody, onchain finality, and offchain speed**.

My lottery isn’t the end, it’s a **starting point** for different gaming applications on Bitcoin.

If you’re a developer looking to build on Bitcoin, **start here on Ark**. The future is **offchain, on Bitcoin**.
